I'm Craig Fowler.  On GitHub I run [@csf-dev ](https://github.com/csf-dev) where my various open source creations live.
I contribute or have contributed to a few other projects but I'm not so prolific outside of my own organisation.

I'm a development lead from the UK specialising in .NET at the backend and web-based front-ends (React is probably my favourite tech but I'll try almost anything).
Where it comes to software I am pretty passionate about:
* Adhering to SOLID principles
* Easy-to-comprehend tests
* Code-first (instead of DB first)
* I prefer convention over configuration
* I like declarative APIs where appropriate
